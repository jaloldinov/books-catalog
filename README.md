# bookstore
### Task: Create catalog of books.
1) For creating, receiving, modifying and deleting books must have API <br />
2) The API must have swagger documentation which you can test methods. <br />
3) When creating an API, you can use any framework (gin, fiber, bego, echo) <br
/>
4) Books should be stored in postgresql <br />
5) There are must be at least two tables in database, for example (books, book_category) and they must be interconnected (reference) <br />
6) Separate API methods from postgres methods to create a microservice and use grpc. (this step is optional)<br />
